# Report Feature widget
The Report Feature widget for Web AppBuilder works with the ArcGIS Data Reviewer for Server extension.

The Report Feature widget enables you to collect and manage data quality feedback from users of your web application. Users can report existing features from the map that are in error or require additional review. They can also identify missing features by sketching them on the map. Feedback is stored in your geodatabase as a Reviewer Result where it is assessed and managed through a defined life cycle workflow.

## Configuring the Report Feature widget

3.	Provide the **Data Reviewer for Server URL**, then click **Set**.
The associated sessions in this new URL map service will populate the Default Session drop-down list.

4.	Select how the Reviewer Technician attribute of a result is populated. Options for populating this attribute include: 
  1.	**Logged in Username**—the active portal username will populate the attribute.
  2.	**Enter a default value**—a pre-defined value will populate the attribute.
  3.	**Allow user input**—the user provides a value during submission.

5.	Select the Reviewer Session to use as your default session from the drop-down list, then click **OK**.

**Note:** To exclude one or more layers, uncheck the check box in the **Include** column.

7.	To edit a layer’s **Alias** name, double-click the current **Alias** name and type in a new name.
